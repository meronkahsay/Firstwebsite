        <p>You're wondering what AkiraChix is and what i will talk about, right? No worries i will tell about it here.</p>
        <p><img src="image/campus_view_thumbnail.jpg" alt="campus" height="700" width="900">
        <p>Akirachix is a one-year fully sponsored residential hands-on technical training program.
           <br>it is the place where i'll be staying for the next 10 months.

           </p>
        <p>Its been a week since i joined the organization.
            The first week at AkiraChix was a complicated emotion.I felt overwhelmed.
            <br>Initialy it was exciting to try new things and capture the moment by taking picture 
            of my self and others.<br>However adapting to new enviroment,meeting a diverse group of people,dealing with homesickness was somehow challenging.

        <h2 style="color: blue;">The Good Things I Enjoyed</h2>
        <Ol>
            <li>Its neat,the place it self makes you feel refreshed. </li>
            <li>it only allows you to focus on your studies.</li>
            <li>it push you hard to become disciplined and organized.</li>
            <li>it does not allow you to be left behind.</li>
        </Ol>
        <h2 style="color: blue;">The things I was Dissapointed with</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>the cleaning part on weekend: ahh don't get me started with this..even though its best for us,
                i think it would be better if they sceduled it all on saturday or Sunday.
                <br> its becoming hard to do my assignment or give myself some time.
             </li>
            <li>waking  up at 5:00 am really,cause i did not get used to that.</li>
            <li>the are no private study rooms available when you need privacy for yourself.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Despite all the good and bad things that have happened, I am enjoying my time at AkiraChix.
            I am improving my self over time and trying to make new friends.<br>
            It can be hard sometimes but this is the sacrifie i am making for better tommorow.
            and finally i miss injera!
           <br> for those who do not know what injera is, this is injera:
